1.systemd - systemd is a daemon that manages other daemons, which, including systemd itself, are background processes. 
          systemd is the first daemon to start during booting and the last daemon to terminate during shutdown.

2.kthreadd - It is the kernel thread daemon. ... Creation of new kernel threads is done via kthreadd so that a clean 
             environment is obtained even if this were to be invoked by userspace by way of modprobe, hotplug cpu, etc.

3.kworker - It is a placeholder process for kernel worker threads, which perform most of the actual processing for the
            kernel, especially in cases where there are interrupts, timers, I/O, etc.

4.ksoftirqd - is a per-cpu kernel thread that runs when the machine is under heavy soft-interrupt load. 

5.oom_reaper - The mechanism the kernel uses to recover memory on the system is referred to as the out-of-memory killer
                or OOM killer for short.
                In short cleans up processes that are Out Of Memory.

6.ksmd - The KSM daemon ksmd periodically scans those areas of user memory which
            have been registered with it, looking for pages of identical content which
            can be replaced by a single write-protected page

7.cpuhp/0 -  Process that supports physically adding and removing CPUs from the system.

8.kausitd - the kernel thread responsible for auditing security events

9.khungtaskd - looks for hung tasks every two minutes

10.dbus-daemon - It is the D-Bus message bus daemon.D-Bus is first a library that provides one-to-one communication 
                 between any two applications; dbus-daemon is an application that uses this library to implement a 
                 message bus daemon. Multiple programs connect to the message bus daemon and can exchange messages with one another.
